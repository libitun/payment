**SolEstate** is a decentralized real estate investment protocol that democratizes ownership of high-value assets. By tokenizing properties into liquid SPL tokens, we remove the high-entry barriers of traditional markets, allowing anyone to own, trade, and earn yield from premium real estate starting with just 1 SOL.

- **Glassmorphic Dashboard** — A state-of-the-art premium UI designed for visual excellence and clarity.
- **On-Chain Registry** — Every property is verified and stored in a decentralized Registry PDA for ultimate transparency.
- **Yield Boost Mechanics** — Lock your real estate tokens for fixed terms to earn higher annual yields.
- **Success Banners** — Real-time transaction feedback with direct Solscan links for every buy, list, or cancel action.
- **Multi-Wallet Support** — Compatible with Phantom, Backpack, and Solflare.

## 👛 Supported Wallets

For the best experience on **SolEstate**, we recommend exploring the platform using one of the following wallets:

- **Solflare (Recommended)** — **Most stable.** Provides accurate transaction simulations and seamless execution.
- **Backpack** — Native support with smooth integration.
- **Phantom** — Supported, but may occasionally show false-positive simulation warnings during complex interactions. If you see a simulation error in Phantom, ensure your devnet balance is sufficient and proceed.

We highly recommend using **Solflare** for a flawless investment experience.

## 📡 P2P Market Logic

The secondary market employs a secure escrow mechanism:
1. **List**: User creates a `SaleListing` PDA. Tokens move from the wallet to the `ListingVault` (escrow).
2. **Buy**: Purchaser sends SOL to the Seller. Tokens move from `ListingVault` to the Buyer.
3. **Cancel**: Seller reclaims tokens from the `ListingVault` and closes the `SaleListing` PDA.

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity

- **Program ID**: `5tPSqDkPUP5sA56K25R2jN2sUrW57mf5m1b6QTPdRzYN`
- **Ownership**: All funds are handled by the Solana System Program or the SPL Token Program via secure PDAs.
- **Permissions**: Only the registered owner of tokens can create or cancel secondary market listings.
